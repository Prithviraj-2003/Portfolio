          The main concept was to bring doctors, patients, and pharmacists onto
          one platform. We developed a web application where patients can upload
          their health records, allowing doctors to access this data for future
          prescriptions. Additionally, doctors can upload new data, and
          pharmacists can access patient information to provide better
          medication prescriptions.

          Integrating Ayurvedic Wisdom: A Comprehensive Approach to Herb and
          Disease Research
        </h3>
        <p>
          This project involved developing a comprehensive database system for
          storing Ayurvedic parameters and associated drugs related to various
          diseases. The application allows users to search for Ayurvedic
          parameters or diseases and receive relevant Ayurvedic medicine
          recommendations, showcasing proficiency in data management and
          application development.

          This major agriculture project addressed real-time problems such as
          scheme details for farmers, verified fertilizers, and farm labor
          sourcing. The project aims to provide farmers with access to schemes,
          qualification criteria, and future plans to integrate AI for crop
          management and an e-commerce platform for buying and selling
          agricultural products.

          The main concept was to bring doctors, patients, and pharmacists onto
          one platform. We developed a web application where the data about
          patients' health records were uploaded by the patient since this data
          is not available to all doctors for future prescriptions. We aimed to
          store all that data on our platform, allowing doctors to access it
          through requests to patients via the application. Additionally,
          doctors could upload new data, and pharmacists' roles included
          accessing the patient data to provide better prescription medicines.
